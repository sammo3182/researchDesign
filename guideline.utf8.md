## Week 1 (2017-08-21/2017-08-23): Being a Political Scientist
This is the first week of our class.
As the beginning, you will read articles by two big names in political science.
They discuss what's political science and how to be a qualified political scientist. 
You are recommended to read Koehane (2009) first and then King (2006).
Try to find the answers to the following questions during your reading.

* According to Keohane, what's political science, and what's the crucial character of political scientists (and students in political science)? 
* What does inference mean in political science research? How are the so-called "descriptive" and "causal" inferences different from each other?
* Why should we care about reliability and validity of inferences?
* Why is experiment the best way to detect causal inferences?
* Do the standards in natural science fit political science? Why or why not?
* What's the way King suggests to start a research project? Why does he recommend it?
* Why does King emphasize to offer a minimal-change analysis before a fully-improved analysis in the replications?


## Week 2 (2017-08-28/2017-08-30): Being A Scientist First!
From this week, we formally start our journey towards being a political scientist.
The first step is to understand how political scientists (or social scientists in general) contribute to improving the insight into human society. 
The first part of Babbie discusses how social scientific inquiries are different from ordinary human inquiries and why they are important and valuable.
The second part of Babbie together with King's influential piece discusses the regular procedure (*please recall how important following a certain procedure is for political science research from last week.*) to conduct a valid and solid social science research. A quick note King (1995), the author tried to talk about every type of audience the piece might expose in "Proposed Solution," you are free to scan all of them, but please pay most attention to his suggestions to the "Authors."

Try to think about the following questions when you read the readings:

* How is scientific theory different from philosophy?
* What are the three main purposes of social research?
* Babbie discusses three dialects in social research, which one is the most important?
* In Babbie's discussion about how to design a research project, what's the relationship between theoretical and empirical blocks?
* According to King, what's the purpose to do replication and why it is important for political science?
* Why are we worrying ourselves with what might be called "duplication" of misting research? Isn't the more important question actual replication where the same measurements are applied to new substantive areas, countries, or time periods?
