## `r weekList[1]`
This is the first week of our class.
As the beginning, you will read articles by two big names in political science.
They discuss what's political science and how to be a qualified political scientist. 
You are recommend to read Koehane (2009) first and then King (2006) and try to answer the following questions.

* According to Koehane, what's political science, and what's the crucial character of political scientists (and students in political science)? 
* What does inference mean in political science research? How are the so-called "descriptive" and "causal" inferences different from each other?
* Why should we care about reliability and validity of inferences?
* Why is experiment the best way to detect causal inferences?
* Do the standards in natural science fit political science? Why or why not?
* What's the way King suggests to start a research project? Why does he recommond it?
* Why does King emphasize to offer a minimal-change analysis before a fully-improved analysis in the replications?
