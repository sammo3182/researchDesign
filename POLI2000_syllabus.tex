\section{Overview}\label{overview}

How do candidates win elections? Why do countries get involved in
international crises and wars? What makes a country more powerful than
the others? What explains the choices of violent non-state actors like
terrorists? There are just some of the questions that political
scientists study. The goal of this course is show you how to research
these questions as a scholar in political science. This course will
introduce students to political science research and various ways that
social scientific research is undertaken.

This class will introduce the core elements of a political science
research, such as concept, theory, hypothesis, and evidence. You will
also learn how to build a new theory, develop testable causal
inferences, and design different approaches to test your theories
empirically. Emphasis will be on an active hands-on learning environment
and fully interactions between the instructor and students. Students can
expect to comprehend the research produced in Political Science and
learn to conduct their own..

\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}

I will base your grade for the course on your performance in the four
areas below. You will get a score for each component, and your total
grade will be the sum of them. The grade points will be translated to
letter grades in the following way: 93-100 A, 90-92.9 A-, 87-89.9 B+,
83-86.9 B, 80-82.9 B-, 77-79.9 C+, 73-76.9 C, 70-72.9 C-, 67-69.9 D+,
63-66.9 D, 60-62.3 D-, 59.9 or less F.

\subsection{Class Performance (10\% attendance + 10\% participation +
5\%
presentation).}\label{class-performance-10-attendance-10-participation-5-presentation.}

Regarding participation, I am looking for you to show that you have
fully read and critically evaluated the assigned readings (all available
in ICON) and are actively engaged with our in-class discussions. Before
each week's class you will receive a one-page reading guideline. It will
give you a hint how to read the week's readings and which part you
should pay special attention to. The guideline will always include a
recommanded reading order and several questions to help you comprehend
the materials.

By the second week, we will decide a presentatoin schedule together. You
will sign in a schedule sheet by picking the topic and articles you are
interested. Starting from the third Monday, every first 20 minutes will
be your show time. The student who signed for that day will make a
10-min presentation about the reading. The presentation should include
three parts: a brief summary about what the article is about and its
relations with other materials, which point in the article impresses you
the most and why, and at least one question you really want to know but
the article does not spell it out. I will evaluate your performance in
each---especially the latter two---aspects (see more details in the
attached rubric). Please cherish this chance to practice your
presentation capability, and there is no chance for make-up presentation
if you miss it.

\subsection{In-class quizzes (10\%)}\label{in-class-quizzes-10}

You will get ten pop quizzes throughout the semester. Each quiz includes
2-3 questions about the required readings we are going to discuss in the
class. (Hint: some questions may come from the reading guide.) At the
end of the semester, the eight highest scores of the ten quizzes will be
recorded to contribute to your final grade. Quizzes will be administered
and completed either at the beginning or the end of class. You cannot
make up any missed or failed quizzes for any reason. Feel free to
discuss the readings with your classmates prior to class. \emph{However,
you cannot share your answers to the reading questions with your
classmates.}

\subsection{Critical Response paper
(12\%)}\label{critical-response-paper-12}

You are expected to submit response papers for the readings of three
\emph{weeks}. You are free to pick any week you like before we start
discussing the materials. (You are free to write a paper for the week
your group lead the opening presentation. However, each group member
need to write his/her response paper independently.) That is, the
response paper about a given week's reading is due by the BEGINNING of
the Monday class (i.e., 15:30) in that week (submit to ICON by this
time). Papers will be evaluate in a 1--100 scale following the rubric
attached at the end. Late paper will be penalized 10 points for each day
of being late. Each paper should be 2-4 pages, double-spaced, 1 inch
margins, and in 12 font size.

In the paper, You needs to cover at three two reading materials of the
week. Moreover, I would like to see

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One and ONLY one paragraphs to summarize each material.
\item
  Some discussion about what do you learn from these materials about the
  week topic.
\item
  Your perspective about the argument in the materials---do you agree
  with the author? If yes, why are his/her arguments convincing for you?
  If not, what's your opinion of the topic?
\item
  Cite other sources if appropriate (but not required).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Examination (20\%)}\label{examination-20}

There is only one exam (viz. midterm) for this course. The exam is
comprised of identification and short essay questions. The exam will be
held on 2017-10-09 in the same class of the lecture.

\subsection{Research Proposal (23\%)}\label{research-proposal-23}

You are expected to submit a research proposal at the end of the
semester. It could be a proposal for your graduation thesis or for a
funding application. The proposal should include at least six parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A overview table (see template on ICON).
\item
  An introduction of your research question and why it is important.
\item
  A brief literature review about what scholars have done on this topic.
  You need to cite at least three articles published in academic
  journals of political science. Your citation should be in the style
  used by the American Political Science Association (see the guideline
  \href{http://www.apsanet.org/portals/54/Files/Publications/APSAStyleManual2006.pdf}{here}).
\item
  A section discussing your theory and hypotheses.
\item
  A section discussing the data and method you plan to use to test your
  theory and why they are the best choice for your project.
\item
  A section discussing the operational feasibility of your research
  design.
\end{enumerate}

The proposal is expected at least 10 pages (excluding the title and
reference pages), double-spaced, 1 inch margins, and in 12 font size.
The proposal will be evaluated according to the rubric attached.

Here are some important dates relating to the research proposal:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You must get your research question approved by the instructor by
  2017-10-01.
\item
  You must submit a brief about your theory by 2017-11-12.
\item
  The proposal is due by 2017-12-15. Late paper will be penalized 30
  points for each day of being late.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extra credit}\label{extra-credit}

You will get 5 extra credits if you use bibliography management
softwares (Endnote, Jabref, Zotero, etc. see more information about
these softwares
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software}{here}.)
and submit relevant bibliography files with your proposal.

You can get another 5 credits by attending an academic workshop held by
the Department of Political Science and send me a one-paragraph
discussion about what the workshop is, how you feel about it, and a
selfie at the workshop location.

\section{CLAS Teaching Policies \& Resources --- Syllabus
Insert}\label{clas-teaching-policies-resources-syllabus-insert}

\subsection{Administrative Home}\label{administrative-home}

The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the administrative home of
this course and governs matters such as the add/drop deadlines, the
second-grade-only option, and other related issues. Different colleges
may have different policies. Questions may be addressed to 120 Schaeffer
Hall, or see the CLAS Academic Policies Handbook at
\url{https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook}.

\subsection{Electronic Communication}\label{electronic-communication}

University policy specifies that students are responsible for all
official correspondences sent to their University of Iowa e-mail address
(({\textbf{???}})). Faculty and students should use this account for
correspondences
(\href{https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/human-resources/professional-ethics-and-academic-responsibility\#15.2}{Operations
Manual, III.15.2}, k.11).

\subsection{Accommodations for
Disabilities}\label{accommodations-for-disabilities}

The University of Iowa is committed to providing an educational
experience that is accessible to all students. A student may request
academic accommodations for a disability (which includes but is not
limited to mental health, attention, learning, vision, and physical or
health-related conditions). A student seeking academic accommodations
should first register with Student Disability Services and then meet
with the course instructor privately in the instructor's office to make
particular arrangements. Reasonable accommodations are established
through an interactive process between the student, instructor, and SDS.
See \url{https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/} for information.

\subsection{Nondiscrimination in the
Classroom}\label{nondiscrimination-in-the-classroom}

The University of Iowa is committed to making the classroom a respectful
and inclusive space for all people irrespective of their gender, sexual,
racial, religious or other identities. Toward this goal, students are
invited to optionally share their preferred names and pronouns with
their instructors and classmates. The University of Iowa prohibits
discrimination and harassment against individuals on the basis of race,
class, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and other identity
categories set forth in the University's Human Rights policy. For more
information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity,
\href{mailto:diversity@uiowa.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversity@uiowa.edu}}, or
visit
\href{https://diversity.uiowa.edu/office/equal-opportunity-and-diversity}{diversity.uiowa.edu}.

\subsection{Academic Honesty}\label{academic-honesty}

All CLAS students or students taking classes offered by CLAS have, in
essence, agreed to the
\href{https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code}{College's
Code of Academic Honesty}: ``I pledge to do my own academic work and to
excel to the best of my abilities, upholding the
\href{https://newstudents.uiowa.edu/iowa-challenge}{IOWA Challenge}. I
promise not to lie about my academic work, to cheat, or to steal the
words or ideas of others; nor will I help fellow students to violate the
Code of Academic Honesty.'' Any student committing academic misconduct
is reported to the College and placed on disciplinary probation or may
be suspended or expelled
(\href{https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook}{CLAS Academic Policies
Handbook}).

\subsection{CLAS Final Examination
Policies}\label{clas-final-examination-policies}

The final examination schedule for each class is announced by the
Registrar generally by the fifth week of classes. Final exams are
offered only during the official final examination period. No exams of
any kind are allowed during the last week of classes. All students
should plan on being at the UI through the final examination period.
Once the Registrar has announced the date, time, and location of each
final exam, the complete schedule will be published on the Registrar's
web site and will be shared with instructors and students. It is the
student's responsibility to know the date, time, and place of a final
exam.

\subsection{Making a Suggestion or a
Complaint}\label{making-a-suggestion-or-a-complaint}

Students with a suggestion or complaint should first visit with the
instructor (and the course supervisor), and then with the departmental
DEO. Complaints must be made within six months of the incident
(\href{https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook}{CLAS Academic Policies
Handbook}).

\subsection{Understanding Sexual
Harassment}\label{understanding-sexual-harassment}

Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens
the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. All members of the UI
community have a responsibility to uphold this mission and to contribute
to a safe environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual
harassment should be reported immediately. See the UI
\href{https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/}{Office of the Sexual Misconduct Response
Coordinator} for assistance, definitions, and the full University
policy.

\subsection{Reacting Safely to Severe
Weather}\label{reacting-safely-to-severe-weather}

In severe weather, class members should seek appropriate shelter
immediately, leaving the classroom if necessary. The class will continue
if possible when the event is over. For more information on Hawk Alert
and the siren warning system, visit the
\href{https://police.uiowa.edu/emergency-communications}{Department of
Public Safety website}.
