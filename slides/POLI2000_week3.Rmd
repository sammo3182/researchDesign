# Where's my research question?

## KKV's List{.smaller}

1. Choose a hypothesis seen as <span style="color:yellow">important</span> by scholars in the literature but for which <span style="color:yellow">no one</span> has completed a systematic study. ("literature"?)
1. Choose a hypothesis in the literature that we <span style="color:yellow">suspect</span> is been adequately confirmed and investigate whether it is indeed false.
1. Attempt to resolve or provide further  <span style="color:yellow">evidence of one side</span> of a controversy in the literatureâ€”perhaps demonstrate that the controversy wasunfounded from the start.
1. Design research to illuminate or evaluate <span style="color:yellow">unquestioned assumptions</span> in the literature.
1. Argue that an important topic has been <span style="color:yellow">overlooked</span> in the literature and then proceed to contribute a systematic study to the area.

* A question that
    + people care (and/or?)
    + has not been studied (and/or?)
    + the existing confirmation might be wrong (and/or?)
    + relates to one side (and/or?)
    + the premise is wrong (and/or?)
    + something is missing (and/or?)
    
## Why does Geddes feel they are useless?

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
"It assumes, however, that the relevant literature really does contain a considerable accumulation of theory and stylized facts." (Geddes 2010, 29)

* Why does this bother Geddes? (GT)
    + The literature contains only a little consensus.
    + Vage in definition and empirics.
    + Opinions rather than theory. 
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
* What's the dangers?
    + Lost the main points.<br><div class="centered"><img src="image/pennyWise.png" height = 400 /></div>
</div>
    
## So, Geddes suggested
* An intense but unfocused curiosity, intuition, or indignation<br><div class="centered"><img src="image/curiosity.gif" height = 400 /></div> (GT)
* Being creative: observation $\times$ conjecture
    + Model?


## When is the literature useful?

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
* Stimulus<br><br><div class="centered"><img src="image/stimulus.gif" height = 400 /></div>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
* Expectation<br><br><div class="centered"><img src="image/expectation.gif" height = 400 /></div>
</div>

## Why is inductive research useful?
* Inductive? 
    + prevailing?
    + Danger? 
        + Correlation is not causation.
* Analytic narratives
    + Tracing the mechanism
    + Focusing on the fundamental unit
    + Next step?
        + Empirical evidence
        
## Example: Barrington Moore{.smaller}
"No bourgeois, no democracy" (1966, 418): The likelihood of democracy increases once the size of the bourgeoisie has passed a certain threshold.

* When
    + Democracies would not be expected to occur  <span style="color:yellow">before</span> the industrial and commercial revolutions.

* Where
    + The establishment of democracies would be expected first in the countries that  <span style="color:yellow">industrialized</span> first.
    + Democracy would be less likely in countries in which wealth comes mainly from the  <span style="color:yellow">export</span> of mineral resources.
    + Democracy would be less likely in countries in which  <span style="color:yellow">foreigners or pariah capitalists</span> excluded from the political community own most enterprises.
    
* How
    + In the contemporary world, democracy would be more likely in  <span style="color:yellow">more industrialized</span> countries.
    + The likelihood of democracy would decline as  <span style="color:yellow">state ownership</span> of economic resources rose.
