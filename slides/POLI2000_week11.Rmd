## Confusions of case study

* Small-N
* Ethnographic analysis in the field
* Process-tracing
* Single-phenomenon investigation
<br><br>

* Are they complete definitions of case study?

## Gerring's definition

An intensive study of a single unit for the purpose of understanding a larger class of (similar) units (2004, 342).

* Unit: 
    + boundaries?
        + Spatial?
        + Temporal?
        
## Observations? variables? Cases? Unites?

```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame(A_Case = "A Case",
  A_Variable = paste0("Observation ", 1:3),
                      A_Unit = "A Unit")
colnames(text_tb) <- c(" ", "A Variable", " ")

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "lcc")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25) %>%
      column_spec(1:3, width = "7em")
```

* Is the U.S. a case, an observation, a unit, or a population?

## Design a case study

* What are we looking for? 
    + Covariational relations
* How can we do it?
    + Type I: one unit over time
    + Type II: n subunit at one time
    + Type III: n subunit over time
    
## Alternative choices

* cross-sectional
* Time-series cross-sectional
* Hierarchical
* Comparative historical

## When are case studies useful?

* Descriptive rather than causal inferences
* Deep rather than broad, bounded scope of proposition
* Comparing rather than represent other cases
* Causal mechanism rather than effect
* Deterministic rather than probabilisitic relations
* Exploring rather than confirmatory test
* Implication: <span style="color:red">what's a like/unlike case</span>?

## Why don't we let the case be representative?
