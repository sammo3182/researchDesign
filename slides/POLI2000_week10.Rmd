## How do experiments define causality?

* Rubin's causal model:
    + Treatment effect:<br><br><div class="centered">
<img src="image/rubin.jpg" height = 300 />
</div>
        + ATE: $E(\tau_i) = E(Y_{i1}) - E(Y_{i0})$

----

Averaged treatment effect among the treated
* Why do we care?
* $E(\tau_i|T_i = 1) = E(Y_{i1}|T_i = 1) - E(Y_{i0}|T_i = 1)$
    
    
## Independence?

Subject will have the same effect regardless which group they are in.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Assumption:& E(Y_{i1}|T_i = 1) = E(Y_{i1}|T_i = 0);\\
           & E(Y_{i0}|T_i = 1) = E(Y_{i0}|T_i = 0).\\
ATE:&        E(\tau_i) = E(Y_{i1}|T_i = 1) - E(Y_{i0}|T_i = 0).
\end{aligned}
$$

## Experimental Assumptions

1. Exclusion restriction
1. Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)
1. Montonicity
1. Nonzero causal effects of assignment on treatment
