# Quiz Time!!

## Focus?
When you have a topic or question of interest, what can you do with it?

* Exploring
* Describing
* Explaining

## Exploration

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/exploration.gif" height = 200 />
</div>

* What to explore?
    + Satisfying curiosity.
    + Testing the feasibility of more works.
    + Developing methods.
* Weak points?

## Describing

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/description.jpg" height = 500 />
</div>

## US Census

# Oh, Causality!
<div class="centered">
<img src="image/causality.jpg" height = 300 />
</div>


## Explanation in general
* Case-focused: Ideographic explanation
    + Complete, in-depth understanding of a single case
* Pattern-focused: Nomothetic explanation
    + Defence for causality

## Critera for nomothetic explanation

* The variables must be correlated.
* The cause takes place before the effect.
* The variables are nonspurious.

## Correlation
"An empirical relationship between two variables such that (1) changes in one are as- sociated with changes in the other, or (2) particular attributes of one variable are associated with particular attributes of the other." (Babbie 94)

```{r correlation, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
dt_corr <- data.frame(x1 = sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(x_high = x1 + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 5),
         x_medium = x1 + rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 20),
         x_low = sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)) %>%
           gather(key = "Correlation", value = "x2", 2:4) %>%
             mutate(Correlation = str_sub(Correlation,start = 3),
                    Correlation = factor(Correlation, levels = c("high", "medium", "low")))

ggplot(dt_corr, aes(x = x1, y = x2)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Correlation)
```

## So, if you have to dump someone...

## Time-order

## Spurious relationship

"A coincidental statistical correlation between two variables, shown to be caused by some third variable." (Babbie 94)

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/spurious.png" height = 400, width = 1000 />
</div>

## Three false criteria

* Complete causation
* No exception
* Majority rule

## Complete causation

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/necessarySufficient.png" height = 400 />
</div>

## Exception (probability)

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/exception.jpg" height = 400 />
</div>

## Majority rule

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/socrates.jpg" height = 500 />
</div>

## Build your explanation with the right bricks

Unit of Analysis

## If you used the wrong bricks,...

## Reductionism

(Reductionist fallacy, individualist fallacy, exception fallacy)

An example:

* Hank: I ran my car off the side of the road because that damn squirrel ran in front of my car.
* Officer: You don't think it had anything to do with the fact that you were trying to text your girlfriend, and driving drunk?


## Beyond Causality

Ragin's purpose of soical research:

1. identifying patterns and relaitonships.
1. testing and refining theories.
1. making predictions
1. interpreting culturally and or historically significant phenomena
1. exploring diversity
1. giving voice
1. advancing new theories.

## Predicting

* What's prediting?
* Why is it important?
* What's the relation of this purpose with explanation?

## Interpreting

Theda Skocpol (1979): *States and Social Revolutions*

* Surveying the revolutions in Russia, France, and China
* Two arguments:
    + Starting: crisis of state (international factor) + patterns of class domiance
    + Outcome: crisis + socioeconomic/international constrains
    

## Giving voice

* Studies of gender rights
* Studies of environmentalism
* Studies of social media
* Studies of terrorism

## No research exists in vacuum!

* Concerning the substantive questions
* Relying on empirical evidence:
    + cross-sectional
    + time-series
