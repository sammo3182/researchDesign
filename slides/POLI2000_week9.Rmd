## How to understand causation?

<div class="centered">
<img src="image/causation.gif" height = 300 />
</div>

* Find A is causal, rather than random, consequence.
* How do we identify the causes of A?
* How do we justify B is a cause of A?


## Pluralist view?

* $\neq$ multicausality<br><br><div class="centered">

</div>

Pluralist view: formal causes, material causes, efficient causes, determistic causes, probabilistic causes, correlational causation, causal mechanisms...

* Different explanations for the same causation
* Different perspective of the same causal explanation.

## Why not pluralist view?

* Over-stating the differenct-ness
* Not benefiting the research

## A universal view

* A minimal definition
* 16 criteria of formal properties of causal arguments
* 8 criteria for research design

## Defining causation

Cause: Events or conditions that raise the prior probability of some outcome occurring, under ceteris paribus conditions (Gerring 2005, 169).

* $P(Y|X) > P(Y|-X).$
* Why a minimal causation?
    + Hint: Sartori's ladder
* Bayesian framework?
    + $Y(A|B) = \frac{Y(B|A)Y(A)}{Y(B)}$
    + $Posterior = \frac{Likelihood\times Prior}{Evidence}$
