* What the bi~~ is paradigm?
    + "A model or frame of reference through which to observe and understand." (Babbie 32)
    + Epistemology? Approach? Method? 


## Positivism

"Scientific truths could be positively verified through empirical observations and the logical analysis of what was observed." (Babbie 35)

* Reality is *independent* from human feelings, ideas, perceptions.
* Social phenomena have to be treated like *physical objects*.
* Knowledge is *value-free, objective, measurable*.
* Knowledge can only be accessed objectively through a *scientific approach*.

## Rational choice

## Structuralism

## Culturalism
